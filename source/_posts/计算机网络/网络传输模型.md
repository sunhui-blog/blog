    <p>KEY DIFFERENCE</p>
    <ul>
      <li>OSI has 7 layers whereas TCP/IP has 4 layers.</li>
      <li>The OSI Model is a logical and conceptual model that defines network communication used by systems open to interconnection and communication with other systems. On the other hand, TCP/IP helps you to determine how a specific computer should be connected to the internet and how you can be transmitted between them.</li>
      <li>OSI header is 5 bytes whereas TCP/IP header size is 20 bytes.</li>
      <li>OSI refers to Open Systems Interconnection whereas TCP/IP refers to Transmission Control Protocol.</li>
      <li>OSI follows a vertical approach whereas TCP/IP follows a horizontal approach.</li>
      <li>OSI model, the transport layer, is only connection-oriented whereas the TCP/IP model is both connection-oriented and connectionless.</li>
      <li>OSI model is developed by ISO (International Standard Organization), whereas TCP Model is developed by ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network).</li>
      <li>OSI model helps you to standardize router, switch, motherboard, and other hardware whereas TCP/IP helps you to establish a connection between different types of computers.</li>
